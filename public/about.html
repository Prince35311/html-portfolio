    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>I'm a passionate web developer with experience in building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications. 
    I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks to bring ideas to life on the web.</p>

    <h3>Game Streamer</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Vincent Agunloye — a passionate online game streamer and content creator with a deep love for tactical shooters and football simulation games. I specialize in streaming high-intensity FPS titles like Delta Force and Call of Duty, as well as in-depth football strategy games like Football Manager. With a growing community of like-minded gamers, my goal is to provide entertaining, competitive, and insightful content that brings players together from all over the world.</p> 
    <p>Gaming for me is more than just a hobby — it’s a lifestyle. I’ve spent years developing my gameplay skills, understanding game mechanics, and building a personal brand that reflects my unique style. Whether I’m navigating a covert mission in Delta Force, coordinating team strategy in Call of Duty, or managing a club to the Champions League title in FM Manager, I bring focus, energy, and creativity to every stream.</p>
    <p>My streaming journey began out of pure passion. What started as casual sessions quickly evolved into a full-fledged platform where I interact with viewers, share tactical gameplay, break down strategies, and have fun while doing it. Today, I stream regularly across platforms, engaging with a vibrant audience that values not just gameplay but community, authenticity, and shared experiences.</p>
    <p>In Delta Force and Call of Duty, I focus on smart tactical decisions, sharp shooting skills, and team coordination. I thrive in competitive environments where quick thinking and precision matter. I often run missions with a strategic edge — whether it’s outflanking opponents, mastering weapon loadouts, or surviving intense firefights. I also enjoy discussing weapon mechanics, loadout optimization, and game updates with my audience.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the spectrum is my love for Football Manager, where I take on the role of a virtual coach and club manager. I enjoy diving deep into squad building, tactics, transfer strategies, and youth development. My FM streams are all about long-term planning, underdog stories, and turning mid-table clubs into European giants. Viewers tune in to see me scout the next world-class wonderkid or pull off an unexpected upset in the Champions League.</p>
    <p>One of the key values I bring to my streaming and portfolio is consistency and growth. I believe in creating content that not only entertains but also educates and connects. I’m always looking to improve — from learning new editing techniques to upgrading my stream setup — and I love involving my audience in that journey.</p>
    <p>When I’m not live, I’m often editing highlights, creating tutorials, engaging with my community on Discord, or researching new trends in the gaming world. I stay updated with the latest game releases, patches, and community challenges to ensure my content remains fresh and relevant.</p>
    <p>In the future, I plan to expand into collaborative streams, tournaments, and exclusive behind-the-scenes content. I also aim to explore brand partnerships and monetization opportunities that align with my gaming values and audience.</p>
    <p>If you’re a fan of tactical shooters, football sims, or just enjoy engaging game commentary with a touch of humor and realism, you’re in the right place. Welcome to my world — let’s play smart, win big, and build a legacy together.</p>
